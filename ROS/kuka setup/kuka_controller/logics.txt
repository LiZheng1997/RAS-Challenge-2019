1. we want to use the NLP algorithms to control the robot.
    so we have to define our key words, and design the logic 
    function about how to move the arm to a locaton and get the 
    item to another place.

    Task 1: 
    Move the item to a default location 
    Move the items to a default location

    Move the item to a wanted location 
    Move the items to a wanted location

    How to move and pick:

    1. Before start moving and picking, we should to check the state of the robot.
    2. move close to the place we want or default place. (we know the location of the item)
    3. check if the gripper is opened ror not.
    4. move exact to the place 
    5. close the gripper
    6. move close to the place we want to drop
    7. move exact to the place we want to drop
    8. opend the gripper
    9. get back to the home position
